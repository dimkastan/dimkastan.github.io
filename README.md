## Welcome to my personal github blog

### _Italic_ About this blog

In this blog I plan to share publicly some usefull projects, ideas, tutorials, notes etc. for Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
Stay tuned!



### About me

I was born in Athens in 1984. I received my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineer from T.E.I. of Patras (2005-2009) and M.Sc. degree in Electronics and Information Processing (2009-2011) from the Department of Physics, University of Patras, Greece. In May 2017, I received my PhD in the area of Computer Vision and Machine Learning from the Department of Physics, University of Patras, Greece, under the supervision of Prof. Spiros Fotopoulos. During my PhD I worked on Multi-level Machine Learning Methods for Activity Analysis/Recognition. My research interests include Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition for activity analysis and image understanding as well as learning feature representation method. I have also been working on the problem of HEp-2 cell classification. Since 2013 I also work at IridaLabs S.A., as and Software Engineer for Computer Vision and Machine Learning solutions mainly for embedded systems.
