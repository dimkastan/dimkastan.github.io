This article presents this commonly faced problems and some health check and suggestions to help teams for teams early detect them\nProblem description While Agile provides an iterative approach for project management, promoting change, collaboration, adaptive planning, and flexibility in responses, often it is misused as a non-ending sprint loop. In principle agile methodologies like Scrum, clearly define that at every sprint, the team is building a potentially releasable increment. In this manner, the team, while in a short term, is delivering value to the customer. However, many stakeholders or customers that are sticked to the traditional project management, fail to actively participate in this iterative development approach.\nSymptoms Here are two main symptoms that are usually noticed across agile teams.\nStakeholders waiting for something “complete” at every sprint to move on. It has to be very clear that this will never happen. Each sprint ensures that a small increment is built- and potentially released. Even if that happens, that means that either the product was too simple, or that something is really missing. Here is crucial to elicitate feedback from the stakeholders and feedback from actual releases. Stakeholders never stop asking for improvements and introduce new features/products There is also the trap of continuously asking for new features or even changing the specification. While this is normal as new features naturally arise in agile development, the team has to acknowledge that new features should arise if and only if they are mandatory in order to address the defined objective. Otherwise, customers/stakeholders will always raise the bar by hiding behind the “deliver value to the customer” excuse. Proposed actions Agile, and in particular Scrum is based on the pillars of Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation. If followed thoroughly all parties will benefit by the flexibility provided by the framework. Here are some recommendations/ health-checks for teams following the Agile development methodology\nMake sure that your increments reach the real customers Don’t delay releases if and only if the concern is expressed by some stackeholders, team members If someone is causing the team to procrastinate the release try to understand what are his/hers concerns Agile applies for the whole product. If one (sub) team is using different approach make sure this is not intervening to the agile process Don’t judge agile development cycles with a traditional project management perspective Discovery is part of progress. If the team is not delivering something useful, try to communicate that in the review Ask the team if the increment is providing new features o Check the acceptance criteria- if need to update to maximize value make sure that this is not by adding a new feature Hope this will help you in your agile journey!\n","date":1670112e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670803200,"objectID":"9deb04f63448ece068e3d8f6712c8cd4","permalink":"https://dimkastan.github.io/post/endless-development-cycle-in-agile-teams/","publishdate":"2022-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/endless-development-cycle-in-agile-teams/","section":"post","summary":"Some agile teams are facing an endless development cycle.

This phenomenon follows the principle that nature is built on some very common princinples. Additionally, as human beings we tend to immitate nature- including biological organisms. For example, aeronautical engineers used concepts observed in bird spiecies to design aircrafts. Machine learning engineers are inspired by human brains and their ability to learn from examples. This article provides a brain inspired business organization and operation analogy, hoping that will help teams understand some fundamental concepts immanent to a organ that is designed to learn, develop, adapt, act, visualize and imagine! Brain inspired business organization structure and operations Introduction Human brain is a complex organ responsible for coordinating our body functions and maintaining a status of the self amongst other tasks. During the wake state, our brain perceives information from the environment and creates representations of the word, develops new skills that are vital for our surviving and important for every interaction with the outer world. Neuroscientists are constantly unfolding the knowledge around brain functionality which despite important for the neuroscience field is didactic and source of inspiration for other scientific fields. A characteristic example is the area of Machine Learning where a system tries to imitate the ability of a human brain to learn feature feature mappings between domains given some examples- usually accompanied with a supervisory signals. In the early days Sparse Representations were imitating the ability of the visual cortex to encode visual information while more recently, deep learning methods try to replicate brain’s ability to build hierarchical representations in a simplified digital model. In this article, I am presenting the organization structure of a business from a brain inspired perspective. Human brains evolve, visualize, learn, create structures, create data processing channels, store information while they try to reduce the energy consumption by optimizing structures that support common activities. Similarly, a business is evolving, learns how to adapt to the market, creates structures, dedicated units to perform specific actions, automates processes and changes it’s structure over time. It is therefore obvious that a business can benefit by understanding or relating its substance with that of a human brain.\nAnalogy Human brains receive information from various sensors. These sensors are naturally limited to gather specific information and the brain creates meaningful representations under several objectives. For a specific period, the human brain matures, creating more complex structures reaching at a plateau at some point. Then, these structures are optimized to minimize energy consumption, however the journey does not stop there. New memories come over, new skills are developed and different parts of the brain can start contributing in different tasks over time.\nIn a similar manner a businesses mature, develop new skills, create a representation of the world- as it is perceived- and change their structure. Businesses, collect information and make steps based on an internal representation of the actual world (e.g. market).\nFrom a brain inspired business organization analogy, it is evident that:\nAs long as the business grow, its structure will be subject to change A business organizationsneeds to optimize and create strong connections Parts of a business might need to change roles/functions Learning new skills is mandatory business organizations sense only what they observe Be aware that there is always missing information Be aware of the level of detail needed It is very common for people to believe that they observe their world around them in great detail. Scientific experiments have shown however, that the humans see in a very abstract manner. To understand that try to sketch a one dollar or euro. This is a great example showcasing that the level of detail needed to perform a task is not always very fine-grained. Businesses organizations need to provide the least amount of details in order to avoid an overflow of information which might hide what’s important or affect information from other topics to be observed.\nOrganization Plasticity and catastrophic forgeting Businesse organizations should be agile and flexible in order to survive. Of vital importance is to have departments that can gradually shift to a different specialization by learning/developing new skills. In this manner, existing resources are reused and further benefit by transferring concepts from different areas of expertise. Also be aware that once new tasks are learnt, old will gradually fade out in favor of new skills and memories. Therefore, organization plasticity should be strategically orchestrated.\nOn making decisions- while avoiding illusions Humans make decisions every in instance. …","date":1670025600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670025600,"objectID":"096f48a8cc3a9209916b1ccf6d4e4501","permalink":"https://dimkastan.github.io/post/brain-inspired-business-organization/","publishdate":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/brain-inspired-business-organization/","section":"post","summary":"Scientists are known for their ability of transfering concepts from one domain to another.

Whilst this is very common in complext problems, teams always tend to ‘blame’ the first steps of the project as opposed to searching for adaptation.When teams stick on this mindset, they tend to repeat the same mistakes over and over again and when they retrospect the see only the mistakes or wrong choices made in the beggining and overlook the importance to learn and adapt. This article, presents this mindset as a historical recurrence trap and suggests some methods that will (hopefully) help teams spot and escape from it.\nintroduction Mark Twain once said, “History never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme”. In school we were taught that people should learn from history, meaning that humans need to learn from past mistakes. However, people really struggle to follow this rule of thumb- and there is a reason for that. Indeed, apart from politics and sociology, people face the same challenge in everyday lives meaning, family, work and personal relationships. In this short article, I will focus on the “Historic recurrence” effect in technological teams.\nProblem description A new project is about to commence and depending of the selected way-of-work the team is somehow structured. While discussing the what, the how and the when, one of the most used phrases noticed amongst peers is, namely, the “let’s build it right this time” or “let’s organize it better”, “let’s sell it better”, “let’s design it better“, following the “Let’s it better” structure. Ideally, it should stop there, the statement should be followed by the “do it right” solution and the project should run within budget, time and scope leaving the end user/customer satisfied. However, it seems that this phrase is quite vague depicting lack of structure, processes, or even experience. Let’s dig a little bit into this phrase.\nAnalysis This statement should not be underestimated. It is a strong indicator that some team members were not satisfied by the way they worked in the past or the result of their work. What is difficult to understand is that this can vary across team members according to their objectives. For example, business people try to optimize the outcome within the given budget. Project managers try to control the budget, scope and time while development teams try to generate as much value as possible for the customer with the minimal possible technical debt. These teams need to find a balance and it is not guaranteed at all that all of them will be satisfied at the same time. For business people, this statement could refer to their disappointment regarding budget and revenue. Project managers could use it to highlight to the team the importance of providing more “accurate” estimations. Finally the development teams could refer to the technical debt as well as prolonged latencies in getting feedback from the customers. However, teams should comprehend that they are trying to jointly optimize different objectives. This is very common in Machine learning tasks formulated as multi-task and/or multi-objective problems or constraint optimization problems, where an objective is optimized subject to several predefined criteria. As Machine Learning teaches us, we are always responsible for what we choose to optimize against as well as how we evaluate out results and the tradeoffs within. For example, you might have the right objective but the training data might not be representative of the problem or we might be interested in reducing False Positives in favor of increasing the False Negative Rate.\nWhat you can do? Here are some suggestions to help your team be better prepared and well-structured next time:\nUnlearn Within complex projects/products it very common that more is unknown than known. Agile methodologies cope with complexity by iteratively working on solving the problem by taking one small step at a time and checking both the output and when to go next (review) as well as the way teams, that adopt them, work (retrospective). In this manner, it often takes a team to unlearn in order to drop the tools used to work until now and build new strategies.\nAvoid the mount stupid The well known Dunning-Kruger effect tells us that oftenly people tend to overestimate their abilities leading to poor decisions and those decisions are later transformed into project failures, technical debt and/or customer dissatisfaction.\nEngage people with range Todays wicked problems require generalists. While specialists in a team can do the job optimally, generalists can also help to do the right job.\nHear all the voices: Imposter syndrome After working for many years, you realize that things you do actually work and that your ideas are usually applicable. Lot’s of people however, believe that this is due to luck and they keep believing that they do not hold any expertise amongst their peers.
