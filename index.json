Whilst this is very common in complext problems, teams always tend to ‘blame’ the first steps of the project as opposed to searching for adaptation.When teams stick on this mindset, they tend to repeat the same mistakes over and over again and when they retrospect the see only the mistakes or wrong choices made in the beggining and overlook the importance to learn and adapt. This article, presents this mindset as a historical recurrence trap and suggests some methods that will (hopefully) help teams spot and escape from it.\nintroduction Mark Twein once said, “History never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme”. In school we were taught that people should learn from history, meaning that humans need to learn from past mistakes. However, people really struggle to follow this rule of thumb- and there is a reason for that. Indeed, apart from politics and sociology, people face the same challenge in everyday lives meaning, family, work and personal relationships. In this short article, I will focus on the “Historic recurrence” effect in technological teams.\nProblem description A new project is about to commence and depending of the selected way-of-work the team is somehow structured. While discussing the what, the how and the when, one of the most used phrases noticed amongst peers is, namely, the “let’s build it right this time” or “let’s organize it better”, “let’s sell it better”, “let’s design it better“, following the “Let’s it better” structure. Ideally, it should stop there, the statement should be followed by the “do it right” solution and the project should run within budget, time and scope leaving the end user/customer satisfied. However, it seems that this phrase is quite vague depicting lack of structure, processes, or even experience. Let’s dig a little bit into this phrase.\nAnalysis This statement should not be underestimated. It is a strong indicator that some team members were not satisfied by the way they worked in the past or the result of their work. What is difficult to understand is that this can vary across team members according to their objectives. For example, business people try to optimize the outcome within the given budget. Project managers try to control the budget, scope and time while development teams try to generate as much value as possible for the customer with the minimal possible technical debt. These teams need to find a balance and it is not guaranteed at all that all of them will be satisfied at the same time. For business people, this statement could refer to their disappointment regarding budget and revenue. Project managers could use it to highlight to the team the importance of providing more “accurate” estimations. Finally the development teams could refer to the technical debt as well as prolonged latencies in getting feedback from the customers. However, teams should comprehend that they are trying to jointly optimize different objectives. This is very common in Machine learning tasks formulated as multi-task and/or multi-objective problems or constraint optimization problems, where an objective is optimized subject to several predefined criteria. As Machine Learning teaches us, we are always responsible for what we choose to optimize against as well as how we evaluate out results and the tradeoffs within. For example, you might have the right objective but the training data might not be representative of the problem or we might be interested in reducing False Positives in favor of increasing the False Negative Rate.\nWhat you can do? Here are some suggestions to help your team be better prepared and well-structured next time:\nUnlearn Within complex projects/products it very common that more is unknown than known. Agile methodologies cope with complexity by iteratively working on solving the problem by taking one small step at a time and checking both the output and when to go next (review) as well as the way teams, that adopt them, work (retrospective). In this manner, it often takes a team to unlearn in order to drop the tools used to work until now and build new strategies.\nAvoid the mount stupid The well known Dunning-Kruger effect tells us that oftenly people tend to overestimate their abilities leading to poor decisions and those decisions are later transformed into project failures, technical debt and/or customer dissatisfaction.\nEngage people with range Todays wicked problems require generalists. While specialists in a team can do the job optimally, generalists can also help to do the right job.\nHear all the voices: Imposter syndrome After working for many years, you realize that things you do actually work and that your ideas are usually applicable. Lot’s of people however, believe that this is due to luck and they keep believing that they do not hold any expertise amongst their peers.

Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) imaging of human epithelial type-2 cells (HEp-2) is the dominant protocol used for the identification of ANA.

In this work, we focus on the task of HEp-2 cell classification and we propose a novel method for local feature encoding that allows us to generalize the concept of residual encoding in sparse vectors. More specifically, our method hierarchically aggregates the residual of the feature vectors’ sparse representation leading to a Vector of Hierarchically Aggregated Residuals (VHAR). Using SIFT descriptors computed on a dense grid and multiple scales, as well as considering spatial information our method achieves 78.0% classification and 82.3% mean class rate (MCR) on ICPR2012 and ICPR2014 HEp-2 cell contest datasets respectively.","tags":null,"title":"HEp-2 cell classification with Vector of Hierarchically Aggregated Residuals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["  Dimitris Kastaniotis  and Spiros Fotopoulos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506816000,"objectID":"cef0a3a6f2217d50c24e0d580fe80fc4","permalink":"https://dimkastan.github.io/publication/erci-gait/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/erci-gait/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, we propose Kinect Aided Diagnosis (KAD) system for assessing the state of patients diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).","tags":null,"title":"KAD - An Intelligent System for Categorizing and Assessing the State of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["  Dimitris Kastaniotis ,Ilias Theodorakopoulos, George Economou and Spiros Fotopoulos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1452556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1452556800,"objectID":"2b6e332e8d70d55053f77a6991404177","permalink":"https://dimkastan.github.io/publication/gait_rec_fuse_eucl_rieman/","publishdate":"2016-01-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gait_rec_fuse_eucl_rieman/","section":"publication","summary":"Gait is a particular periodical type of human motion with several unique characteristics for every person. In this work we focus on the problem of pose based gait recognition. The contribution of the proposed work is threefold.

Secondly, we propose a method which allows us to fuse information from feature representations from both Euclidean and Riemannian spaces by mapping data in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).

Antinuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) identification can be accomplished in a laboratory using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) imaging.

Our method utilizes two descriptors in order to encode gradient and textural characteristics of the depicted patterns. Along with distribution of SIFT features, we propose the new GoC-LBP descriptor based on co-occurrences of uniform Local Binary Patterns along directions dictated by the orientation of local gradient. At a second stage, the descriptors are fused while creating a dissimilarity representation of an image.

In this context, we propose a method for action recognition where skeletal data are initially processed in order to obtain robust and invariant pose representations and then vectors of dissimilarities to a set of prototype actions are computed. The task of recognition is performed in the dissimilarity space using sparse representation. A new publicly available dataset is introduced in this paper, created for evaluation purposes.
